            David Andrew Leo Fincher (born August 28, 1962) is an American film director. His films, mostly
            psychological thrillers and biographical dramas, have received 40 nominations at the Academy Awards,
            including three for him as Best Director.

            Born in Denver, Colorado, Fincher was interested in filmmaking at an early age. He directed numerous music
            videos, most notably Madonna's "Express Yourself" in 1989 and "Vogue" in 1990, both of which won him the MTV
            Video Music Award for Best Direction. He made his feature film debut with Alien 3 (1992), which garnered
            mixed reviews, followed by the thriller Seven (1995), which was better received. Fincher found lukewarm
            success with The Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999), but the latter eventually became a cult classic. In
            2002, he returned to prominence with the thriller Panic Room starring Jodie Foster.

            Fincher also directed Zodiac (2007), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and
            Mank (2020). For The Social Network, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and BAFTA Award for
            Best Direction. His biggest commercial successes are The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Gone
            Girl (2014), both of which grossed more than $300 million worldwide, with the former earning thirteen
            nominations at the Academy Awards, and eleven at the British Academy Film Awards.

            Mindhunter (2017–19), winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the
            pilot episode of House of Cards. Fincher was the co-founder of Propaganda Films, a film and music video
            production company.
